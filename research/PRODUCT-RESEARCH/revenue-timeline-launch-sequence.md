# Revenue Timeline & Launch Sequence

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive market research across Fleet SaaS, Consumer OBD, Insurance Telematics, and Small Fleet markets, we recommend a phased launch strategy prioritizing:

1. **Small Fleet Tracking** (Fastest to market, lowest risk)
2. **Consumer OBD Device** (High margin, network effect)
3. **Enterprise Fleet SaaS** (Higher revenue, longer sales cycle)
4. **Insurance Telematics B2B2C** (Highest potential, requires partnerships)

**Total Year 1 Revenue Target:** $650K-850K
**Total Year 3 Revenue Target:** $3.5M-5M
