# Fleet Management SaaS Competitive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The fleet management SaaS market is dominated by 4 major players with annual contract values of $300-600 per vehicle. All require 3-year contracts except Motive (12 months). This creates an opportunity for Piston Labs to enter with:
- **Shorter contracts** (month-to-month or 12-month)
- **Lower pricing** (leveraging existing Teltonika infrastructure)
- **Better UX** (modern dashboard vs legacy interfaces)
