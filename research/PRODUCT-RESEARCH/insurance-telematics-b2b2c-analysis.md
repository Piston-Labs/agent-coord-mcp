## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT)** - Powers major insurer programs
- **Octo Telematics** - European leader, global expansion
- **LexisNexis Telematics Exchange** - Platform model
- **Arity (Allstate)** - Proprietary data arm

### Our Differentiation
1. **Shop Network Integration** - Unique maintenance/repair data
2. **Independent Shop Focus** - Underserved market segment
3. **Consumer Device Play** - B2C footprint enables B2B2C
4. **Lower Infrastructure Cost** - Existing Teltonika investment

---

## Regulatory Considerations

- **Consumer Consent** - Must be explicit and granular
- **Data Minimization** - Collect only what's needed
- **Right to Deletion** - CCPA/GDPR requirements
- **Anti-Discrimination** - Telematics can't be used for protected class pricing
- **State Variations** - Different rules per state (e.g., California restrictions)
