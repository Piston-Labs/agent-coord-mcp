# Small Business Fleet Solutions Analysis (5-50 Vehicles)

## Executive Summary

Small service businesses (landscaping, plumbing, HVAC, pest control) are **underserved** by enterprise fleet solutions. They need simple, affordable tracking without 3-year contracts or features they'll never use.

**Market Trend:** Moving away from all-in-one platforms toward focused, affordable solutions.

**Piston Labs Opportunity:** Target this segment with $15-20/vehicle pricing, month-to-month contracts, and features tailored to service businesses.
