# Small Fleet Market Analysis (5-50 Vehicles)

## Executive Summary

Small fleet operators (5-50 vehicles) represent a significant underserved segment of the fleet management market. These businesses—landscaping, HVAC, plumbing, delivery services—have unique pain points around cost sensitivity, simplicity, and integration with existing tools.

**Key Opportunity:** Pricing gap exists between budget solutions ($2-5/vehicle/month) with limited features and enterprise solutions ($23-45/vehicle/month) with overwhelming complexity. A middle-tier offering at $15-20/vehicle with focused features could capture significant market share.
