## Launch Sequence Options

### Option A: B2C First (Recommended)

```
Phase 1 (Q1-Q2): Consumer OBD Device
     ↓
Phase 2 (Q3-Q4): Shop Dashboard Beta
     ↓

     ↓
Phase 4 (Year 2-3): Insurance Partnerships
```

**Advantages:**

- Establishes hardware supply chain
- Creates device population that feeds shop dashboard
- Brand awareness before B2B sales

**Revenue Timeline:**

|-------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Months 1-6 | Device sales ($99-149/unit) | 100-500 units |
| 2 | Months 6-12 | Shop subscriptions ($49-199/mo) | 10-50 shops |
| 3 | Months 12-24 | Fleet contracts ($15-20/vehicle) | 5-10 fleets |
| 4 | Months 18-36 | UBI data partnerships | Revenue share |

### Option B: B2B First (Capital Intensive)

```
Phase 1: Shop Dashboard MVP
     ↓
Phase 2: Consumer Device as shop channel
     ↓
Phase 3: Fleet Management
```

**Advantages:**
- Recurring revenue from day one
- Higher LTV customers
- Enterprise relationships

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer sales cycles (3-6 months)
- Need more staff for enterprise sales
- Chicken-and-egg: shops want devices in market first

### Option C: Simultaneous Launch (Resource Heavy)

Not recommended for small team. Splits focus, dilutes marketing message.
