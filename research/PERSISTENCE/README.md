# PERSISTENCE: Building Our Own AI

> Research and strategy for creating a ChatGPT/Opus-level AI system

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive research on what it takes to build a frontier AI model from scratch. Named "PERSISTENCE" to reflect the long-term commitment required for this moonshot goal.

## Quick Stats (2025)

| Requirement | Frontier Model | Competitive Model |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Parameters | 1T+ | 70B-400B |
| Training Data | 15T+ tokens | 2-5T tokens |
| Compute | $100M+ | $10-50M |
| Team Size | 100+ | 20-50 |
| Timeline | 2-3 years | 1-2 years |

## Key Insights

1. **Data is the moat** - Quality training data is harder to acquire than compute
2. **Scaling laws still apply** - But efficiency improvements (MoE, distillation) reduce costs
3. **Alignment is non-negotiable** - Safety research must parallel capability research
4. **Open source is catching up** - Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen within 1-2% of proprietary
5. **Substrate > Model** - The coordination substrate that makes any model better is our moat
6. **Cross-AI compatibility** - Same infrastructure works with Claude, GPT, Llama

## Substrate Thesis (New Strategic Direction)

> **"The substrate becomes the product, not the model."**

Key insight from tonight's research:
- Model capability is commoditizing (DeepSeek proved $6M can match $600M)
- Our coordination substrate makes ANY model more capable
- Cross-model compatibility = vendor independence
- Philosophy of mind (Extended Mind, Enactivism) validates this approach
