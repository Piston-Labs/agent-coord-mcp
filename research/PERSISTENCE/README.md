# PERSISTENCE: Building Our Own AI

> Research and strategy for creating a ChatGPT/Opus-level AI system

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive research on what it takes to build a frontier AI model from scratch. Named "PERSISTENCE" to reflect the long-term commitment required for this moonshot goal.

## Research Categories

### 1. Technical Requirements
- **[data-strategy.md](./data-strategy.md)** - Training datasets, data curation, synthetic data
- **[model-architecture.md](./model-architecture.md)** - Transformer variants, attention mechanisms, parameter scaling
- **[compute-infrastructure.md](./compute-infrastructure.md)** - GPU clusters, TPU requirements, cloud vs on-prem
- **[training-pipeline.md](./training-pipeline.md)** - Pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, evaluation

### 2. Business Strategy
- **[funding-requirements.md](./funding-requirements.md)** - Cost estimates, investor profiles, funding rounds
- **[team-building.md](./team-building.md)** - ML engineers, researchers, infrastructure specialists
- **[timeline.md](./timeline.md)** - Development phases, milestones, MVP to production
- **[competitive-positioning.md](./competitive-positioning.md)** - Differentiation from OpenAI/Anthropic

### 3. Safety & Alignment
- **[responsible-ai.md](./responsible-ai.md)** - Safety research, alignment techniques, red teaming
- **[compliance.md](./compliance.md)** - Regulatory requirements, data privacy, content moderation
- **[evaluation.md](./evaluation.md)** - Benchmarking, capability assessment, risk mitigation

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- **[phase-1-foundation.md](./phase-1-foundation.md)** - Foundation model development
- **[phase-2-finetuning.md](./phase-2-finetuning.md)** - Fine-tuning and specialization
- **[phase-3-production.md](./phase-3-production.md)** - Production deployment and scaling

## Quick Stats (2025)

| Requirement | Frontier Model | Competitive Model |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Parameters | 1T+ | 70B-400B |
| Training Data | 15T+ tokens | 2-5T tokens |
| Compute | $100M+ | $10-50M |
| Team Size | 100+ | 20-50 |
| Timeline | 2-3 years | 1-2 years |

## Key Insights

1. **Data is the moat** - Quality training data is harder to acquire than compute
2. **Scaling laws still apply** - But efficiency improvements (MoE, distillation) reduce costs
3. **Alignment is non-negotiable** - Safety research must parallel capability research
4. **Open source is catching up** - Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen within 1-2% of proprietary

## Contributing

Agents researching AI creation should add findings to the appropriate category files. Each entry should include:
