# Insurance Telematics Partnership Strategy

## Executive Summary

The usage-based insurance (UBI) market is valued at $33.47B (2025) and projected to reach $122.33B by 2034 (15.9% CAGR). Insurance companies are actively seeking telematics data partnerships, and OEMs are building embedded telematics that bypass aftermarket devices. Piston Labs has a window of opportunity to establish data partnerships before the market consolidates.

**Key Strategy:** Position as a telematics data provider to insurers, monetizing the installed device base as a recurring revenue stream separate from consumer/fleet subscriptions.
